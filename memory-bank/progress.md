# Brain Dump App - Progress Tracking

## Current Status Overview

### What Works
✅ Basic voice recording
✅ Whisper transcription
✅ Basic task/event detection
✅ MongoDB integration
✅ Real-time UI updates
✅ Basic error handling
✅ NLP service for improved text processing
✅ Entity extraction (people, locations)
✅ Time and date handling
✅ Thought deduplication

### What Needs Improvement
⚠️ Task detection accuracy (improved but still needs work)
⚠️ Meeting deduplication (improved but still needs work)
⚠️ Metadata extraction (improved but still needs work)
⚠️ Processing feedback
⚠️ Error recovery

### What's Missing
❌ Comprehensive testing
❌ Performance monitoring
❌ Advanced error handling
❌ Offline support

## Phase 1 Progress: Rule-Based Processing

### Completed
- [x] Create NLP service structure
- [x] Implement entity extraction in `src/services/nlp/entities.ts`
- [x] Improve time processing in `src/services/nlp/time.ts`
- [x] Implement deduplication logic

### In Progress
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests

### Blocked
- None

### Next Steps
1. Write tests for NLP service
2. Refine regex patterns based on test results
3. Measure accuracy improvements

## Phase 2 Progress: LLM Integration

### Completed
- [ ] None yet - Awaiting Phase 1 completion

### In Progress
- [ ] None - Planning phase

### Blocked
- Phase 1 testing completion required

### Next Steps
1. Create prompt templates
2. Implement processing pipeline
3. Add validation
4. Add metrics

## Phase 3 Progress: UI Improvements

### Completed
- [ ] None yet - Awaiting Phase 2

### In Progress
- [ ] None - Planning phase

### Blocked
- Phase 2 completion required

### Next Steps
1. Update ProcessingStatus component
2. Add progress indicators
3. Improve metadata display
4. Enhance error handling

## Current Issues

### High Priority
1. Task Detection
   - Missing contextual tasks (improved but still needs work)
   - Status: Partially addressed in Phase 1, needs testing
   - Example: "tidy plate" not detected

2. Meeting Duplication
   - Duplicate events in output (improved but still needs work)
   - Status: Partially addressed in Phase 1, needs testing
   - Example: "Meeting with Karen" shown twice

3. Metadata Display
   - Incomplete/missing metadata
   - Status: To be addressed in Phase 3
   - Example: Empty "With:" fields

### Medium Priority
1. Processing Feedback
   - Limited status updates
   - Status: To be addressed in Phase 3

2. Error Handling
   - Basic error messages
   - Status: To be addressed in Phase 3

3. Performance
   - No monitoring
   - Status: To be addressed in Phase 5

### Low Priority
1. Test Coverage
   - Limited tests
   - Status: Ongoing throughout phases

2. Documentation
   - Basic documentation
   - Status: Ongoing throughout phases

## Recent Progress
