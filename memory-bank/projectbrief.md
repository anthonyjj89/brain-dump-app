# Brain Dump App - Project Brief

## Overview
Brain Dump is a voice-to-text task management application that helps users capture and organize their thoughts, tasks, and events through natural speech. The app uses advanced natural language processing to understand, categorize, and structure user input into actionable items.

## Core Features
- Voice-to-text transcription
- Automatic task and event detection
- Natural language understanding
- Real-time processing feedback
- Organized task/event management

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Next.js API routes
- Database: MongoDB
- APIs: 
  - OpenAI Whisper (transcription)
  - Claude-3-Haiku (NLP)
- Testing: Jest

## Current Challenges
1. Task Detection
   - Missing contextual tasks (e.g., "tidy plate", "brush cat")
   - Inconsistent task categorization

2. Event Handling
   - Meeting information duplication
   - Incomplete metadata extraction (time, location, people)
   - Time format inconsistencies

3. User Experience
   - Limited processing feedback
   - Inconsistent metadata display
   - Error handling improvements needed

## Project Goals
1. Improve Processing Accuracy
   - Task detection rate > 95%
   - Event deduplication rate > 99%
   - Metadata extraction accuracy > 90%

2. Enhance Performance
   - Processing time < 2s
   - LLM usage reduced by 50%
   - Error rate < 1%

3. Better User Experience
   - Clear processing feedback
   - No duplicate events
   - Complete metadata display
   - Intuitive error handling

## Timeline
- Total Duration: ~4.5 weeks
- Phase 1 (Rule-Based Processing): 1 week
- Phase 2 (LLM Integration): 1 week
- Phase 3 (UI Improvements): 1 week
- Phase 4 (Testing & Documentation): 3 days
- Phase 5 (Monitoring & Optimization): 2 days
- Buffer: 1 week

## Success Criteria
1. Processing Accuracy
   - Task/event detection with false positive/negative rates < 5%
   - Successful deduplication of similar events
   - Accurate metadata extraction (time, date, person, location)

2. Performance Metrics
   - Voice processing under 2 seconds
   - UI responsiveness < 100ms
   - Reduced LLM API costs
   - Error rate below 1%

3. User Experience
   - Clear processing status indicators
   - Consistent metadata display
   - Intuitive error messages
   - User satisfaction metrics

## Future Considerations
1. Integration Capabilities
   - Calendar sync
   - Task manager integration
   - Mobile app development

2. Advanced Features
   - Custom task/event templates
   - Recurring event detection
   - Priority inference
   - Location suggestions

3. Scalability
   - Multi-user support
   - Team collaboration features
   - Enterprise deployment options
