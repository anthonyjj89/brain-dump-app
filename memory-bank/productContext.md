# Brain Dump App - Product Context

## Problem Statement
People often have thoughts, tasks, and events that come to mind throughout the day. Traditional note-taking and task management apps require manual input and categorization, which can be:
- Time-consuming
- Disruptive to workflow
- Error-prone
- Inconsistent in organization

## Solution
Brain Dump provides a natural, voice-first approach to capturing and organizing thoughts:
1. Users speak their thoughts naturally
2. App transcribes speech to text
3. NLP automatically categorizes and structures the input
4. Information is organized into tasks, events, and notes
